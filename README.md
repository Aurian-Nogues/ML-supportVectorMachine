# ML-supportVectorMachine
Matlab / Octave program to implement a Support Vector Machine

This programs finds the decision boundary for a non linear data set using Support Vector Machine algorithm

data.mat - exemple dataset
gaussianKernel.m - Gaussian kernel for SVM
plotData.m - Plot 2D data
svmPredict.m - SVM prediction function
svmTrain.m - SVM training function
visualizeBoundary.m - Plot non-linear boundary
training.m - script that calls the different functions to visualise data, train the SVM, predict outcomes and plot decision boundary
